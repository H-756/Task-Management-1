# Task-Management-1
The objective of this task is to create a program that can help a small business manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. The program will work with two text files, user.txt and tasks.txt, which store the usernames and passwords for users and a list of tasks assigned to the team. The program should allow users to login, register new users (only allowed by 'admin' user), add tasks, view all tasks, and view tasks assigned to the current user. The program should only allow the 'admin' user  to register new users, and has the additional menu option to display statistics, including the total number of tasks and users in a user-friendly manner.
